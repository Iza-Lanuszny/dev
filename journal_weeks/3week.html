                <p>This week was about content optimization and monitoring how search engines react to my site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I performed regular "site:" searches. Google has successfully indexed the homepage, but the Journal is still pending, so I requested a re-crawl in Search Console.</li>
                    <li>I selected my primary keywords: "Izabela Lanuszny Portfolio" to target local search results.</li>
                    <li>I improved the navigation between my Journal and the main page to ensure a better flow for both users and search engine crawlers.</li>
                    <li>I expanded the "About Me" section. Adding more text helps search engines understand the context of my website better.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </article>

                <h3>4th week</h3>
                <time datetime="2025-12-15">15.12.25</time> - <time datetime="2025-12-21">21.12.25</time>
            </header>

            <section class="weeks__content">
                <p>I focused on improving the performance issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I established a clear connection between the Home, CV, and Journal pages. Good internal linking helps Googlebot discover all subpages more efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Instead of using "click here," I implemented descriptive anchor texts. This provides context to search engines about the content of the linked pages.</li>
                    <li>I ensured that all file names are SEO-friendly (lowercase, using hyphens instead of spaces), which makes the URLs easier for both users and crawlers to read.</li>
                    <li>I implemented a custom favicon to ensure the site looks professional in search results (SERP) and browser tabs, which helps with brand recognition.</li>
                </ul>
